The Task
--------
1. Write DFS/BFS implementations in C and Java with search expression parsing (I've used Recursive Descent Parser in Java).
2. Compare implementations based on paradigms, languages and their features used. Make a report.

The report may be found [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/ilyaigpetrov/49c776d96ceb0041b5c6) or diplicated to other formats in the `Report` subdirectory.
