This was a freelance task which I completed and didn't get paid.

The Task
--------
1. Write DFS/BFS implementations in C and Java with search expression parsing (I've used Recursive Descent Parser in Java).
2. Compare implementations based on paradigms, languages and their features used. Make a report.

The report may be found in the `Report` subdirectory.
